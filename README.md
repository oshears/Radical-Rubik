Project Goal: 
============
The goal of this game/simulation application is to provide users with an interactive and 
virtual alternative to solving, or simply toying with, a Rubik’s Cube. The application demonstrates a 
comprehensive hold-and-click control system and intuitive perspective based effects (i.e. shadows, 
lighting and objects). The player may shuffle the Rubik’s Cube by simply pressing the “K” button on the 
keyboard, and may access the in-game settings menu where they can alter the game’s audio or 
graphical configurations.
